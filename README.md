# Integrate [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) into the Linux desktop.

This project is not an offical Jupyter project.

By running the BASH script on common Linux systems

    ./start_jupyterlab.sh

JupyterLab is installed into a Python 3
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
alongside with the [octave_kernel](https://github.com/Calysto/octave_kernel).

The final setup can be easily launched from the distribution's start menu.

[GNU Octave](https://www.octave.org) is assumed to be already installed
and available from the command line by running the `octave`-command.
